Build system, packaging, documentation:
- C++ code is based on C++20 and thus requires a compiler supporting it, e.g.
  g++ 9 or later (10 is recommended and will be necessary for the next release)
  or Visual Studio 2022 or later
- Updated catch2 to 2.13.7
- 3rd party updates of SDL (2.0.20), FreeType (2.11.1), Tcl (8.6.12), libogg
  (1.3.5) and libvorbis (1.3.7)
- Fixed FreeBSD run time crash at startup


And of course the usual various bug fixes and performance improvements.

In "doc/manual/index.html" you can find a set of HTML manuals for openMSX.
Make sure you read this if you haven't used openMSX before, but also to learn
more about the new and changed features.

CPU and graphics performance varies a lot, depending on the openMSX settings
and the MSX hardware and software you're emulating. Some things run fine on a
200 MHz machine, others are slow on a 2 GHz machine. For performance tuning
tips, see the Setup Guide.

openMSX is confirmed to run on the following operating systems: Linux, Windows,
macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD; on x86, x86-64, PPC, ARM, MIPS and Sparc
CPU's. Running on other operating systems (wherever SDL runs) or CPU's should
be possible, but may require some modifications to the build system. If you are
compiling on a new platform, please share your experiences (see below for
contact info), so we can make openMSX more portable.
